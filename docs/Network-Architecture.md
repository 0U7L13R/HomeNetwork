## Sniffer Setup

The Dell R720 has 4 dedicated NIC ports.  
For packet analysis in the SOC, one port is reserved as a sniffer, while the other three are used for load balancing.  

### Steps
1. Configured NIC ports **1â€“3** as **trunk ports** with identical settings.  
   - (I orignally didn't think of this and had headaches on why I couldn't access ESXi)  
2. Reserved **NIC port 4** as the sniffer interface.  
   - Configured to receive a mirror/SPAN of all switch traffic.  
3. Unplugged the sniffer port during ESXi setup.  
4. In ESXi, created a **dedicated virtual switch** bound only to NIC port 4.  
5. Plugged NIC port 4 back in.  
   - The interface now listens passively to all mirrored traffic.
